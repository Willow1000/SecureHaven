SECURE BACKUP RETRIEVAL UTILITY
===============================
Companion script for the Secure Password Vault system.
Used to decrypt and extract local encrypted backups when the main vault is inaccessible.

This script locates and decrypts the encrypted backup file created by the main
password vault application, allowing data recovery in emergency situations.

Dependencies: pyzipper, getpass (built-in), platform (built-in), os (built-in)
